# CreeperBot
A Discord Bot I made for fun, with some simple commands! (Based on a meme)
The reason I've made this, is because I wanted to practice and learn more about JavaScript

# Setup
In order to setup this project, simply download all the code and put the files in a separate folder.
Then, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are in.
And type command `npm i discord-irc`, then type command `node index.js` to start the bot
